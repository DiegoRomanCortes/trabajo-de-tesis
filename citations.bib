	abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.}

The time evolution of the density matrix could be mapped to the corresponding Fokker--Planck equation of a classical quasiprobability distribution using the positive P representation of the phase space. Using the Langevin stochastic equation, we examine the scenarios where the system functions at varied evanescent coupling profiles, coupled modes interaction, competing nonlinear response and ultimately when the second harmonic generation and self-action Kerr interaction are present or absent. We analyze the behavior of squeezing and how the evolution is affected by the presence of coupled nonlinearity. We show that the interplay of linear and nonlinear effects in coherently driven coupled waveguide networks has the potential to be a valuable source of squeezed light.},

abstract="In our simulations, the Fourier transform is calculated using the freely available FFTW implementation of the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4]. Therefore, it should be noted that the discrete Fourier transform implies periodic boundary conditions which can lead to numerical instabilities since energy reaching one edge of the numerical grid automatically reenters from the other side. Although these effects can usually be neglected as long as the beam stays localized, it may cause problems if the propagation of larger beams or the interaction between several beams is considered. Apart from the very inefficient way of simply enlarging the grid, these problems can be circumvented by introducing absorbing boundary conditions.",

abstract={The discovery of artificial gauge fields controlling the dynamics of uncharged particles that otherwise elude the influence of standard electromagnetic fields has revolutionised the field of quantum simulation. Hence, developing new techniques to induce these fields is essential to boost quantum simulation of photonic structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of an artificial gauge field in a photonic lattice by modifying the topological charge of a light beam, overcoming the need to modify the geometry along the evolution or impose external fields. In particular, we show that an effective magnetic flux naturally appears when a light beam carrying orbital angular momentum is injected into a waveguide lattice with a diamond chain configuration. To demonstrate the existence of this flux, we measure an effect that derives solely from the presence of a magnetic flux, the Aharonov-Bohm caging effect, which is a localisation phenomenon of wavepackets due to destructive interference. Therefore, we prove the possibility of switching on and off artificial gauge fields just by changing the topological charge of the input state, paving the way to accessing different topological regimes in a single structure, which represents an important step forward for optical quantum simulation.},
