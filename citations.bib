abstract="In our simulations, the Fourier transform is calculated using the freely available FFTW implementation of the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4]. Therefore, it should be noted that the discrete Fourier transform implies periodic boundary conditions which can lead to numerical instabilities since energy reaching one edge of the numerical grid automatically reenters from the other side. Although these effects can usually be neglected as long as the beam stays localized, it may cause problems if the propagation of larger beams or the interaction between several beams is considered. Apart from the very inefficient way of simply enlarging the grid, these problems can be circumvented by introducing absorbing boundary conditions.",
