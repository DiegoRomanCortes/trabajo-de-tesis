title={Transport and localization on dendrite-inspired flat band linear photonic lattices},

abstract={The capacity of a physical system to transport and localize energy or information is usually linked to its spatial configuration. This is relevant for integration and transmission of signals as performed, for example, by the dendrites of neuronal cells. Inspired by recent works on the organization of spines on the surface of dendrites and how they promote localization or propagation of electrical impulses in neurons, here we propose a linear photonic lattice configuration to study how the geometric features of a dendrite-inspired lattice allows for the localization or propagation of light on a completely linear structure. We show that by increasing the compression of the photonic analogue of spines and thus, by increasing the coupling strength of the spines with the main chain (the ``photonic dendrite''), flat band modes become prevalent in the system, allowing spatial localization in the linear -- low energy -- regime. Furthermore, we study the inclusion of disorder in the distribution of spines and show that the main features of ordered systems persist due to the robustness of the flat band states. Finally, we discuss if the photonic analog, having evanescent interactions, may provide insight into linear morphological mechanisms at work occurring in some biological systems, where interactions are of electric and biochemical origin.},

abstract = {A major challenge in inverse design of optical splitters is to efficiently reach platform nonspecific designs constrained to multiple functional requirements: arbitrary splitting ratio, low insertion loss, broad bandwidth and small footprint. While the traditional designs fail to fulfill all these requirements, the more successful nanophotonic inverse designs require substantial time and energy resources per device. Here, we present an efficient inverse design algorithm that provides universal designs of splitters compliant with all above constraints. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we design splitters with various splitting ratios and fabricate 1\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;N power splitters in a borosilicate platform by direct laser writing. The splitters show zero loss within the experimental error, competitive imbalance of \&lt;0.5 dB and broad bandwidth in the range 20\&\#x2009;\&\#x2212;\&\#x2009;60 nm around 640 nm. Remarkably, the splitters can be tuned to achieve different splitting ratios. We further demonstrate scaling of the splitter footprint and apply the universal design to silicon nitride and silicon-on-insulator platforms to achieve 1\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;5 splitters with the footprints as small as 3.3 \&\#x00B5;m \&\#x00D7; 8 \&\#x00B5;m and 2.5 \&\#x00B5;m \&\#x00D7; 10.3 \&\#x00B5;m, respectively. Owing to the universality and speed of the design algorithm (several minutes on a standard PC) our approach renders 100 greater throughput than nanophotonic inverse design.},

	abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.}

The wavefront of the OAM beams is helical, the intensity at the center of the beam is zero, and there is a phase singularity. Because of the novel phase characteristics of OAM beams, they have a wide application prospect in the fields of optical communication, rotating body detection and particle manipulation. Therefore, the research on the generation technology of OAM beams and their application range are of instructive significance to the future experiments. In this paper, the common beams carrying OAM are introduced, and the techniques of generating OAM beams in free space are summarized, including intracavity conversion method and extracavity conversion method. The application range of OAM beams studied at present is discussed, and the development trend of OAM beams is prospected. The purpose of this paper is to provide reference and guidance for related experiments of OAM beams in the future.}

Using the Langevin stochastic equation, we examine the scenarios where the system functions at varied evanescent coupling profiles, coupled modes interaction, competing nonlinear response and ultimately when the second harmonic generation and self-action Kerr interaction are present or absent. We analyze the behavior of squeezing and how the evolution is affected by the presence of coupled nonlinearity. We show that the interplay of linear and nonlinear effects in coherently driven coupled waveguide networks has the potential to be a valuable source of squeezed light.},

abstract="In our simulations, the Fourier transform is calculated using the freely available FFTW implementation of the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4]. Therefore, it should be noted that the discrete Fourier transform implies periodic boundary conditions which can lead to numerical instabilities since energy reaching one edge of the numerical grid automatically reenters from the other side. Although these effects can usually be neglected as long as the beam stays localized, it may cause problems if the propagation of larger beams or the interaction between several beams is considered. Apart from the very inefficient way of simply enlarging the grid, these problems can be circumvented by introducing absorbing boundary conditions.",

abstract = {As an additional degree of freedom and emerging resource, orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been widely used in both classical and quantum information technologies. Flexible manipulation of OAM modes is fundamentally important to various OAM-based applications. In this Letter, we demonstrate OAM mode conversion in a photonic chip by properly engineering the three-dimensional laser direct writing. More specifically, we find that by increasing the direct-written power, the input OAM±1 modes first remains unchanged, and then transforms into its superpositions. When mapping OAM±2 into the waveguide, it gradually evolves from OAM±1 and its superpositions to OAM±2. This mode conversion is essentially determined by the eigenmodes supported by the waveguide. Furthermore, the input OAM±1 modes can be reversed by tuning the direct-written velocity. Our results demonstrate the more complete manipulation of twisted-light-inside a photonic chip and may further contribute to the integration of high-dimensional quantum information processing.}

abstract={The discovery of artificial gauge fields controlling the dynamics of uncharged particles that otherwise elude the influence of standard electromagnetic fields has revolutionised the field of quantum simulation. Hence, developing new techniques to induce these fields is essential to boost quantum simulation of photonic structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of an artificial gauge field in a photonic lattice by modifying the topological charge of a light beam, overcoming the need to modify the geometry along the evolution or impose external fields. In particular, we show that an effective magnetic flux naturally appears when a light beam carrying orbital angular momentum is injected into a waveguide lattice with a diamond chain configuration. To demonstrate the existence of this flux, we measure an effect that derives solely from the presence of a magnetic flux, the Aharonov-Bohm caging effect, which is a localisation phenomenon of wavepackets due to destructive interference. Therefore, we prove the possibility of switching on and off artificial gauge fields just by changing the topological charge of the input state, paving the way to accessing different topological regimes in a single structure, which represents an important step forward for optical quantum simulation.},
