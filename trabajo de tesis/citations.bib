abstract = {In principle, the temporal beating of superposed high harmonics obtained by focusing a femtosecond laser pulse in a gas jet can produce a train of very short intensity spikes, depending on the relative phases of the harmonics. We present a method to measure such phases through two-photon, two-color photoionization. We found that the harmonics are locked in phase and form a train of 250-attosecond pulses in the time domain. Harmonic generation may be a promising source for attosecond time-resolved measurements.}

abstract={Use of optical traps for the manipulation of biological particles was recently proposed, and initial observations of laser trapping of bacteria and viruses with visible argon-laser light were reported1. We report here the use of infrared (IR) light to make much improved laser traps with significantly less optical damage to a variety of living cells. Using IR light we have observed the reproduction of Escherichia coliwithin optical traps at power levels sufficient to give manipulation at velocities up to ∼500 {\textmu}m s−1 Reproduction of yeast cells by budding was also achieved in IR traps capable of manipulating individual cells and clumps of cells at velocities of ∼100 {\textmu}m s−1. Damage-free trapping and manipulation of suspensions of red blood cells of humans and of organelles located within individual living cells of spirogyra was also achieved, largely as a result of the reduced absorption of haemoglobin and chlorophyll in the IR. Trapping of many types of small protozoa and manipulation of organelles within protozoa is also possible. The manipulative capabilities of optical techniques were exploited in experiments showing separation of individual bacteria from one sample and their introduction into another sample. Optical orientation of individual bacterial cells in space was also achieved using a pair of laser-beam traps. These new manipulative techniques using IR light are capable of producing large forces under damage-free conditions and improve the prospects for wider use of optical manipulation techniques in microbiology.},

The theorem shows that essentially all local theories of natural phenomena that are formulated within the framework of realism may be tested using a single experimental arrangement. Moreover, the predictions by those theories must significantly differ from those by quantum mechanics. Experimental results evidently refute the theorem's predictions for these theories and favour those of quantum mechanics. The conclusions are philosophically startling: either one must totally abandon the realistic philosophy of most working scientists, or dramatically revise out concept of space-time.}

abstract={Ribbon lattices are kind of transition systems in between one and two dimensions, and their study is crucial to understand the origin of different emerging properties. In this work, we study a Lieb ribbon lattice and the localization--delocalization transition occurring due to a reduction of lattice distances (compression) and the corresponding flat band deformation. We observe how above a critical compression ratio the energy spreads out and propagates freely across the lattice, therefore transforming the system from being a kind of insulator into a conductor. We implement an experiment on a photonic platform and show an excellent agreement with the predicted phenomenology. Our findings suggest and prove experimentally the use of compression or mechanical deformation of lattices to switch the transport properties of a given system.},

abstract={The capacity of a physical system to transport and localize energy or information is usually linked to its spatial configuration. This is relevant for integration and transmission of signals as performed, for example, by the dendrites of neuronal cells. Inspired by recent works on the organization of spines on the surface of dendrites and how they promote localization or propagation of electrical impulses in neurons, here we propose a linear photonic lattice configuration to study how the geometric features of a dendrite-inspired lattice allows for the localization or propagation of light on a completely linear structure. We show that by increasing the compression of the photonic analogue of spines and thus, by increasing the coupling strength of the spines with the main chain (the ``photonic dendrite''), flat band modes become prevalent in the system, allowing spatial localization in the linear -- low energy -- regime. Furthermore, we study the inclusion of disorder in the distribution of spines and show that the main features of ordered systems persist due to the robustness of the flat band states. Finally, we discuss if the photonic analog, having evanescent interactions, may provide insight into linear morphological mechanisms at work occurring in some biological systems, where interactions are of electric and biochemical origin.},

abstract = {A major challenge in inverse design of optical splitters is to efficiently reach platform nonspecific designs constrained to multiple functional requirements: arbitrary splitting ratio, low insertion loss, broad bandwidth and small footprint. While the traditional designs fail to fulfill all these requirements, the more successful nanophotonic inverse designs require substantial time and energy resources per device. Here, we present an efficient inverse design algorithm that provides universal designs of splitters compliant with all above constraints. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we design splitters with various splitting ratios and fabricate 1\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;N power splitters in a borosilicate platform by direct laser writing. The splitters show zero loss within the experimental error, competitive imbalance of \&lt;0.5 dB and broad bandwidth in the range 20\&\#x2009;\&\#x2212;\&\#x2009;60 nm around 640 nm. Remarkably, the splitters can be tuned to achieve different splitting ratios. We further demonstrate scaling of the splitter footprint and apply the universal design to silicon nitride and silicon-on-insulator platforms to achieve 1\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;5 splitters with the footprints as small as 3.3 \&\#x00B5;m \&\#x00D7; 8 \&\#x00B5;m and 2.5 \&\#x00B5;m \&\#x00D7; 10.3 \&\#x00B5;m, respectively. Owing to the universality and speed of the design algorithm (several minutes on a standard PC) our approach renders 100 greater throughput than nanophotonic inverse design.},

abstract = {The optical Bloch oscillation (OBO) is an optical-quantum analogy effect that is significant for light field manipulations, such as light beam localization, oscillation and tunneling. As an intra-band oscillation, OBO was important for optical investigations in photonic lattices and atomic vapors over an extended period of time. However, OBO in reconfigurable platforms is still an open topic, even though tunability is highly desired in developing modern photonic techniques. Here we theoretically establish and experimentally demonstrate OBO in an electromagnetically induced photonic lattice with a ramping refractive index, established in a coherently-prepared three-level 85Rb atomic vapor under the electromagnetically induced transparency condition. This is achieved by interfering two coupling beams with Gaussian profiles and launching a probe beam that exhibits OBO within the resulting lattice. The induced reconfigurable photonic lattice possesses a transverse gradient, due to the innate edges of Gaussian beams, and sets a new stage for guiding the flow of light in periodic photonic environments. Our results should motivate better understanding of peculiar physical properties of an intriguing quantum-optical analogy in an atomic setting.}

Yet true Anderson localization effects have not been observed in atomic crystals, as they tend to deviate from the model picture of a periodic potential with fluctuations frozen in time. Now new work carried out at the Haifa Technion confirms localization effects in a true Anderson lattice of a perturbed periodic potential, by using a photonic lattice on which random fluctuations are imposed. These findings raise intriguing questions about the fundamental nature of the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity.},

abstract={Topological quantum matter can be realized by subjecting engineered systems to time-periodic modulations. In analogy with static systems, periodically driven quantum matter can be topologically classified by topological invariants, whose non-zero value guarantees the presence of robust edge modes. In the high-frequency limit of the drive, topology is described by standard topological invariants, such as Chern numbers. Away from this limit, these topological numbers become irrelevant, and novel topological invariants must be introduced to capture topological edge transport. The corresponding edge modes were coined anomalous topological edge modes, to highlight their intriguing origin. Here we demonstrate the experimental observation of these topological edge modes in a 2D photonic lattice, where these propagating edge states are shown to coexist with a quasi-localized bulk. Our work opens an exciting route for the exploration of topological physics in time-modulated systems operating away from the high-frequency regime.},

abstract={Topological insulators are a new class of materials that exhibit robust and scatter-free transport along their edges --- independently of the fine details of the system and of the edge --- due to topological protection. To classify the topological character of two-dimensional systems without additional symmetries, one commonly uses Chern numbers, as their sum computed from all bands below a specific bandgap is equal to the net number of chiral edge modes traversing this gap. However, this is strictly valid only in settings with static Hamiltonians. The Chern numbers do not give a full characterization of the topological properties of periodically driven systems. In our work, we implement a system where chiral edge modes exist although the Chern numbers of all bands are zero. We employ periodically driven photonic waveguide lattices and demonstrate topologically protected scatter-free edge transport in such anomalous Floquet topological insulators.},

	abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.}

Therefore, the research on the generation technology of OAM beams and their application range are of instructive significance to the future experiments. In this paper, the common beams carrying OAM are introduced, and the techniques of generating OAM beams in free space are summarized, including intracavity conversion method and extracavity conversion method. The application range of OAM beams studied at present is discussed, and the development trend of OAM beams is prospected.

Using the Langevin stochastic equation, we examine the scenarios where the system functions at varied evanescent coupling profiles, coupled modes interaction, competing nonlinear response and ultimately when the second harmonic generation and self-action Kerr interaction are present or absent. We analyze the behavior of squeezing and how the evolution is affected by the presence of coupled nonlinearity. We show that the interplay of linear and nonlinear effects in coherently driven coupled waveguide networks has the potential to be a valuable source of squeezed light.},

abstract="In our simulations, the Fourier transform is calculated using the freely available FFTW implementation of the discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4]. Therefore, it should be noted that the discrete Fourier transform implies periodic boundary conditions which can lead to numerical instabilities since energy reaching one edge of the numerical grid automatically reenters from the other side. Although these effects can usually be neglected as long as the beam stays localized, it may cause problems if the propagation of larger beams or the interaction between several beams is considered. Apart from the very inefficient way of simply enlarging the grid, these problems can be circumvented by introducing absorbing boundary conditions.",

abstract = {As an additional degree of freedom and emerging resource, orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been widely used in both classical and quantum information technologies. Flexible manipulation of OAM modes is fundamentally important to various OAM-based applications. In this Letter, we demonstrate OAM mode conversion in a photonic chip by properly engineering the three-dimensional laser direct writing. More specifically, we find that by increasing the direct-written power, the input OAM±1 modes first remains unchanged, and then transforms into its superpositions. When mapping OAM±2 into the waveguide, it gradually evolves from OAM±1 and its superpositions to OAM±2. This mode conversion is essentially determined by the eigenmodes supported by the waveguide. Furthermore, the input OAM±1 modes can be reversed by tuning the direct-written velocity. Our results demonstrate the more complete manipulation of twisted-light-inside a photonic chip and may further contribute to the integration of high-dimensional quantum information processing.}

This method is particularly efficient when the edge modes are kept within the topological gap of the lattice during the transfer. In this work, we show experimentally the transfer of photonic modes between topological edge states located at opposite ends of a dimerized one-dimensional photonic lattice. We use a diamond lattice of coupled waveguides and show that the topological transfer is insensitive to the presence of a high density of states in the form of a flat band at an energy close to that of the edge states and prevails in the presence of a hopping impurity. We explore the dynamics in the waveguide lattice using a wavelength-scan method, where different input wavelengths translate into different effective lattice lengths. Our results offer an alternative way to the implementation of efficient transfer protocols based on active driving mechanisms.}",

abstract={The discovery of artificial gauge fields controlling the dynamics of uncharged particles that otherwise elude the influence of standard electromagnetic fields has revolutionised the field of quantum simulation. Hence, developing new techniques to induce these fields is essential to boost quantum simulation of photonic structures. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of an artificial gauge field in a photonic lattice by modifying the topological charge of a light beam, overcoming the need to modify the geometry along the evolution or impose external fields. In particular, we show that an effective magnetic flux naturally appears when a light beam carrying orbital angular momentum is injected into a waveguide lattice with a diamond chain configuration. To demonstrate the existence of this flux, we measure an effect that derives solely from the presence of a magnetic flux, the Aharonov-Bohm caging effect, which is a localisation phenomenon of wavepackets due to destructive interference. Therefore, we prove the possibility of switching on and off artificial gauge fields just by changing the topological charge of the input state, paving the way to accessing different topological regimes in a single structure, which represents an important step forward for optical quantum simulation.},
